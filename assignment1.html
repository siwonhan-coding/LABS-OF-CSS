      <h3>LYRICS OF THE SONG</h3>

      <p class="p2">
        And said drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah) That we shoot across
        the sky (symphony, pour on a...) <br />
        That we shoot across the sky Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
        <br />
        That we shoot across the sky (symphony, so high, so high) That we shoot
        across the sky <br />
        Oh, angel sent from up above You know you make my world light up <br />
        When I was down, when I was hurt You came to lift me up<br />
        Life is a drink and love's a drug Oh, now I think I must be miles up<br />
        When I was a river dried up You came to rain a flood<br />
        You said drink from me, drink from me When I was so thirsty<br />
        Poured on a symphony Now I just can't get enough<br />
        Put your wings on me, wings on me When I was so heavy<br />
        Poured on a symphony When I'm low, low, low, low<br />
        I, oh-I, oh-I Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high<br />
        Oh-I, oh-I, oh-I Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high (woo)
      </p>

      <p class="p3">
        Oh, angel sent from up above<br />
        I feel you coursing through my blood Life is a drink and your love's
        about<br />
        To make the stars come out Put your wings on me, wings on me<br />
        When I was so heavy Poured on a symphony<br />
        When I'm low, low, low, low I, oh-I, oh-I<br />
        Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high Oh-I, oh-I, oh-I<br />
        I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high I, oh-I, oh-I<br />
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la, so high, so high I, oh-I, oh-I<br />
        Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
      </p>
      <p class="p4">
        That I shoot across the sky<br />
        That I shoot across the That I shoot across the sky<br />
        Let me shoot across the... (Let me shoot) Let me shoot across the sky<br />
        Let me shoot across the Let me shoot across the sky<br />
        That we shoot across the<br />

    <h4>ABOUT THE ARTIST</h4>
    <p class="last">
      Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They consist of
      vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy
      Berryman, drummer Will Champion and manager Phil Harvey.[a] They initially
      met at University College London, calling themselves Big Fat Noises and
      changing to Starfish, before settling on the current name. After
      independently releasing an extended play, Safety (1998), Coldplay signed
      with Parlophone in 1999. The band's debut album, Parachutes (2000),
      included their breakthrough single "Yellow" and received a Brit Award for
      British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album
      and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, A Rush of Blood to the
      Head (2002), won the same accolades and included the single "Clocks",
      which won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Their third album, X&Y
      (2005), which completed what the band considered a trilogy, was nominated
      for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. Their fourth album, Viva la Vida
      or Death and All His Friends (2008), won Best Rock Album. Both albums were
      the best-selling of their respective years, topping the charts in over 30
      countries. Viva la Vida was also nominated for Album of the Year, while
      its title track became the first single by a British group to
      simultaneously reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States in
      the 21st century.
